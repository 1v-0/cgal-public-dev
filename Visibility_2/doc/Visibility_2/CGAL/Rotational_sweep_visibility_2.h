\ingroup PkgVisibility_2Classes

\brief This class is a model of the concept `Visibility_2` can answer visibility queries within a polygon that may have holes.


\details The algorithm does not require preprocessing. It relies on the algorithm of T. Asano \cite ta-aeafvpprh-85 based on angular plane sweep, with a time complexity of \f$O (n \log n)\f$ in the number of vertices.


\tparam Arrangement_2_ is the type used to represent the input environment.
It must be an instance of CGAL::Arrangement_2, where its CGAL::Arrangement_2::Traits_2 must be an instance of 
CGAL::Arr_segment_traits_2, or of CGAL::Arr_non_caching_segment_traits_2. 

\tparam RegularizationTag indicates whether the output should be regularized. It can be
specified by one of the following: ::Tag_true or ::Tag_false, where ::Tag_false is the default value.
