\brief This class is a model of the concept `Visibility_2` can answer visibility queries within
a simple polygon with no holes.

\details This class implements the algorithm of B.Joe and R.B.Simpson \cite bjrb-clvpa-87. 
The algorithm is a modification and extension of the  linear time algorithm of Lee \cite dtl-voasp-83.
It computes the visibility region from a viewpoint that is in the interior or on the boundary of the polygon. 

While scanning the boundary the algorithm uses a stack to manipulate the vertices, and ultimately 
yields the visibility region. For each scanned edge, at most 2 points are pushed onto the stack. 
Overall, at most 2\f$ n \f$ points are pushed or popped. Thus, the time and space complexities of the
algorithm are \f$ O(n) \f$ even in case of degeneracies such as needles, where \f$ n \f$ 
is the number of the vertices of the polygon.

\tparam Arrangement_2_ is the type used to represent the input environment.
It must be an instance of CGAL::Arrangement_2, where its CGAL::Arrangement_2::Traits_2 must be an instance of 
CGAL::Arr_segment_traits_2, or of CGAL::Arr_non_caching_segment_traits_2. 

\tparam RegularizationTag indicates whether the output should be regularized. It can be
specified by one of the following: ::Tag_true or ::Tag_false, where ::Tag_false is the default value.
