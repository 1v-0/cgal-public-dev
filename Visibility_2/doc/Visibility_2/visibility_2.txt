Let \f$ P \f$ be a polygon, which may have proper holes, where "proper" means positive area. Given two points \f$ p \f$ and \f$ q \f$ in \f$ P \f$, they are said to be visible  iff segment joining \f$ p \f$ and \f$ q \f$  contains no point on the exterior of \f$ P \f$. The set of points that are visible from \f$ q \f$ is defined as the visibility region of \f$ q \f$. Let's denote it by \f$ V_q \f$.

Look at Figure \cgalFigureRef{definition-fig}. All labelled points are collinear. According to the definition above, \f$ c \f$ is visible to \f$ q \f$. \f$ V_q \f$ will contain segment \f$ bc \f$, which is called visible needle. In many cases the user is just interested in the regularized visibility area \f$ \overline{V_q} \f$ like Figure \cgalFigureRef{definition-fig} (2). The Chapter \ref PkgBooleanSetOperations2Summary supports the regularization for polygons.

Also for some algorithms it's actually easier to provide \f$ \overline{V_q}  \f$ only. Thus, some visibility computation strategies in this package offer to compute the regularized visibility
area \f$ \overline{V_q} \f$ directly.

To sum up, this package provides two kinds of visibility region of point \f$ q \f$: 
- Non-regularized visibility area \f$ V_q \f$.
- Regularized visibility area \f$ \overline{V_q} \f$. 


\section visibility_2_classes Classes and Algorithms

CGAL provides three class templates that follow the `Visibility_2` concept:
Class 	                	|	Function                                     |  Have Preprocessing                |  Query                            |Algorithm
-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------
 `Simple_visibility_2`       | compute visibility in simple polygons                  |       No                     |\f$ O(n) \f$ time and \f$ O(n) \f$ space  | paper of B.Joe and R.B.Simpson \cite bjrb-clvpa-87
 `Naive_visibility_2`        |  compute visibility in a polygon with proper holes | No                     | \f$ O(n\log n) \f$ time and \f$ O(n) \f$ space |  paper of T.Asano \cite ta-aeafvpprh-85 
 `Preprocessed_visibility_2` | visibility query in a polygon with proper holes       | Yes. \f$ O(n^2) \f$ time and \f$ O(n^2) \f$ space | \f$ O(n) \f$ time and \f$ O(n) \f$ space   | paper of Takao Asano, Tetsuo Asano  etc \cite aaghi-vpsesp-85

where  \f$ n \f$ is the number of vertices of input polygon.

Every templates has two parameters, `Arrangement_2` and `Regularization_tag`. User can attach an instance of `Arrangement_2` as the polygonal environment. `Regularization_tag` indicates whether the result should be regularized or not. 

Each class has two overloads of `visibility_region` functions to compute the visibility region of \f$ p \f$ in a bounded polygonal face \f$ F \f$. One is for the case that \f$ p \f$ is in the interior of \f$ F \f$. The other is for the case that \f$ p \f$ is on the boundary of \f$ F \f$. The answer is returned as an instance of `Arrangement_2` that consists of edges on the boundary of visibility region.

//Given a polygonal region \f$ P \f$, which may have holes, and  two points \f$ p \f$ , \f$ q \f$, in general \f$ p \f$ is said to be visible from \f$ q \f$ iff any inner point on segment joining \f$ p \f$ and \f$ q \f$ is "transparent".  The set of points that are visible from \f$ q \f$ is defined as the visibility region of \f$ q \f$.

//\cgalFigureBegin{definition-fig, definition.png}

//Look at Figure \cgalFigureRef{definition-fig}. Part(1) is a polygon \f$ P \f$ with hole \f$ H \f$. The blue polygon apparently is the visibility region of \f$ q \f$ in \f$ P \f$. In some degenerate situations, the definition of visibility is not that clear. For example, in Part(2), \f$ H \f$ shrinks to a segment which is collinear to \f$ q \f$ and vertex \f$ a \f$ moves to the segment joining \f$ q \f$ and \f$ b \f$. As a result, there are two "needles" in the visibility region of \f$ q \f$: \f$ ed \f$ is an inward "needle"; \f$ bc \f$ is an outward one.


//We proceed to define "transparency" so that these "needles" are naturally contained.
//Given a polygon \f$ P \f$, which may have proper holes, degenerate holes(isolated edges and isolated vertices), there are two types of points that is transparent with respect to point \f$ q \f$.
//-  interior of \f$ P \f$.
//-  vertex \f$ v \f$ if \f$ v \f$ is not isolated and all edges incident to \f$ v \f$ is in the same open half plane defined by line \f$ vq \f$ except \f$v\f$ itself.


//The visibility region based on the definition of transparency above is denoted by \f$ V \f$. In many cases the user is just interested in the regularized visibility area \f$ \overline{V} \f$.Also for some algorithms it's actually easier to provide \f$ \overline{V}  \f$ only. Thus, some visibility computation strategies in this package offer to compute the regularized visibility
//area \f$ \overline{V} \f$ directly.

//To sum up, this package provides two kinds of visibility region:
//- Non-regularized visibility area \f$ V \f$.
//- Regularized visibility area \f$ \overline{V} \f$.
