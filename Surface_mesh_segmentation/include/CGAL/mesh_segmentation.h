 * This function implements the Shape Diameter Function (SDF) as described in \cite shapira2008consistent.
 * After the computation of SDF values for each facet, the following post-processing steps are applied:
 *  - Facets with no SDF values (i.e. zero) are assigned to average SDF value of its neighbors. 
 * If still there is any facet which has no SDF value, minimum SDF value greater than zero is assigned to it.
 *  - Smoothed with bilateral filtering.
 *  - Linearly normalized between [0,1].

 * @brief Function computing the segmentation of a surface mesh given an SDF value per facet.

 * This function fills a property map which associates a segment-id (between [0, number of segments -1]) to each facet.
 * Formally, a segment is a set of connected facets which are placed under same cluster. 
 *
 * Note that there is no direct relation between the parameter @a number_of_levels
 * and the number of segments. However, a large number of levels is likely to result in detailed segmentation of the mesh with large number of segments.

 *
 * Note that for segmenting the mesh several times with different parameters (i.e. number of levels, and smoothing lambda),
